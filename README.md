### **DISCLAIMER: this is WIP and is my current active project**

# Visualizing LGBTQIA+ events around the world all year long

## Tech stack setup

* based on next.js with React, Prisma and Postgres set-up
* using python scrapy to get the data from an existing Wikipedia page

## First iteration

* Using Prisma and Postgres in Vercel for DB **(Done but needs better paging)**
* Focus on nice visualization with map, card and timeline view **(No proper designing and FE work yet)**
* Make it easier overall to discover events in your country

## Later iterations

* scrape data from more sources
* other improvs
